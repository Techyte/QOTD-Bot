# QOTD Discord Bot
 
Wrote a whole nice README and it got deleted so here is the jist of it:

- Use this howver you want (See LICENCE for more details)
- You DM the bot to give it a question
- Delete a message to remove it from the bots list of questions
- From the console you can do stuff like remove questions and force questions
- Fully modular command system (operated from the console)
- You need to set up environment variables such as the bot token, server id, channel id and the time you want the questions to be asked for the defult code (just look up how to set environment variables)
- You will need a discord application to use this, set one up here: https://discord.com/developers/applications
- I don't provide a way of hosting but if you want a suggestion I am using AWS EC2 Windows 10 Instance
- If you care enough I am using DSharpPlus to make this (the dlls should be included with the source code)
- If you need any help with anything email me at contact@techyte.net
